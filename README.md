This game was made during Nordic Game Jam 2025 in Unity and can be played at https://dreunin.itch.io/tooth-pick.

## The tooth fairy is actually a mouse named Dave.
For the past 10 years, he has been working as a debt collector at Tooth Pick Inc. — the famous worldwide supplier of Pearly Whites® and Toothmeal®. 

Due to frequently failing to meet his collection quotas, his boss has given him an ultimatum: "Meet the quota tonight, or you're fired!"
